## A/B testing approach - CTA button "Get my plan" color blue vs green

### Identify the Test Groups:
First things first, I'd identify the groups for my A/B testâ€”let's keep it simple with two groups: Group Blue and Group Green.

### Generate Unique Identifiers:
To ensure consistency, each user needs a unique identifier. I would use cookies for this purpose.

### Create Variations:
Now, it's time to create the variations. I'd design different versions of the CTA button, each with a different color - blue and green.

### Serve Variations:
Based on the unique identifier, I need to determine which variation to serve for each user. I would use a random assignment.

### Implement in Next.js:
In my Next.js components, I'd conditionally render the button variations based on the assigned group for each user.

### Track and Analyze:
Lastly, I'd implement tracking to log user interactions and analyze the results after the testing period.
